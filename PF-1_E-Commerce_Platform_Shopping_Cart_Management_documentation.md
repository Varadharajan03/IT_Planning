## 2. Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

### FR-1: Cart Item Management (Add, Update, Remove)

**Description:** Users must be able to add products to their shopping cart, modify the quantity of existing items, and remove items from the cart. These actions should be reflected immediately in the cart's display and calculations.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A user can add a product to the cart from a product detail page or quick view.
- A user can increase or decrease the quantity of an item already in the cart.
- A user can remove an item from the cart.
- The cart UI updates immediately after any item management action (add, update quantity, remove).
- Attempting to add an item with a quantity of zero or less results in an error or no action.

### FR-2: Display Cart Contents and Totals

**Description:** The shopping cart must accurately display all items added by the user, their individual prices, quantities, and calculate the subtotal, estimated shipping costs, and the grand total, providing transparency to the shopper.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The cart page displays a list of all unique items, including product name, image, price, and quantity.
- The cart page displays the subtotal of all items before taxes and shipping.
- The cart page displays an estimated shipping cost based on the user's location (if available) or a default, with a clear indication it's an estimate.
- The cart page displays the grand total, including subtotal, estimated shipping, and any applicable taxes (if calculated at this stage).
- All price calculations are accurate and reflect current product pricing.

### FR-3: Discount and Promotion Application

**Description:** Users must be able to apply valid discount codes or promotions to their shopping cart, and the cart total should reflect the applied discount, enhancing the platform's ability to drive conversion.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A user can enter a valid discount code in a designated input field on the cart page.
- Upon applying a valid code, the cart total is updated to reflect the discount, and the discount amount is clearly displayed.
- An invalid or expired discount code displays an appropriate error message to the user.
- The system supports applying only one discount code at a time, or clearly defines rules for multiple discounts.
- Users can remove an applied discount code, reverting the cart total to its pre-discount state.

### FR-4: Real-time Inventory Validation

**Description:** The system must validate the availability of items in the cart against current inventory levels in real-time, preventing users from purchasing out-of-stock items or quantities exceeding available stock, and ensuring data integrity for merchants.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When an item is added to the cart, its availability is checked against current inventory.
- If an item is out of stock, the user is notified, and the item cannot be added or is clearly marked as unavailable in the cart.
- If the requested quantity exceeds available stock, the user is notified, and the quantity in the cart is automatically adjusted to the maximum available.
- Inventory checks occur again before proceeding to checkout to ensure final availability.
- The cart clearly indicates items that are low in stock (e.g., 'Only 3 left!') or out of stock.

### FR-5: Persistent Shopping Cart

**Description:** The shopping cart contents must persist across user sessions, allowing logged-in users to return to their cart at a later time or from a different device with their items intact. For guest users, the cart should persist for a defined period (e.g., 24-48 hours) using browser cookies.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- For logged-in users, cart contents are saved to their account and are accessible from any device upon login.
- For guest users, cart contents persist for at least 24 hours via browser cookies.
- If a user logs in with items in a guest cart, the guest cart items are merged with their existing account cart, prioritizing the most recent updates.
- Cart persistence does not interfere with real-time inventory checks (FR-4).
- Items in a persistent cart that become unavailable are clearly marked upon the user's return.

### FR-6: Save for Later Functionality

**Description:** Users should have the option to move items from their active shopping cart to a 'Save for Later' list, allowing them to easily revisit these items without cluttering their current cart, thereby reducing cart abandonment and enhancing user experience.

**Priority:** Medium

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A 'Save for Later' option is available for each item in the active cart.
- Moving an item to 'Save for Later' removes it from the active cart and updates the cart total.
- Saved items are displayed in a separate, clearly labeled section on the cart page or a dedicated 'Saved Items' page.
- Users can move items from 'Save for Later' back to their active cart, subject to current inventory availability.
- Saved items retain their original product details (e.g., price, variant) and are subject to inventory checks when moved back to the cart.

## 3. Risk Analysis

### Analysis Summary
THINKING: The user wants a detailed risk analysis of the "Shopping Cart Management" feature for the PF-1 E-Commerce Platform. I need to leverage the provided PRD, FRDs, and recent risk insights. My output must include a comprehensive explanation of the identified risks, followed by a JSON array structured with `risk_type`, `severity`, `description`, and `law`. I will categorize risks into Requirement, Scope Creep, Project Management, Stakeholder, Technical, Quality, Market/Strategic, and Communication risks.

Here's my plan:
1.  **Read through the PRD and FRDs carefully:** Identify explicit requirements, implicit expectations, business goals, success metrics, and pre-identified risks. Pay attention to priorities and descriptions.
2.  **Analyze Recent Risk Insights:** Connect these insights to potential risks within the PRD context. For example, insights on cart abandonment, security, and inventory management directly inform several risk categories.
3.  **Categorize Risks:** For each identified potential issue, assign it to one of the specified risk types.
4.  **Determine Severity:** Assign a severity (Low, Medium, High) based on the potential impact on business goals, project success, and user experience.
5.  **Formulate Descriptions:** Write clear, concise, and actionable descriptions for each risk, linking them back to specific PRD/FRD elements or insights.
6.  **Assign `law` attribute:** Set to "DDPA" for risks directly related to data protection (e.g., security vulnerabilities leading to data breaches), otherwise "null".
7.  **Structure the Output:** First, the detailed explanation, then the JSON array.

**Detailed Breakdown of Risk Identification:**

*   **Requirement Risk:**
    *   Ambiguity in "estimated shipping costs" (FR-2) and "taxes (if calculated at this stage)" (FR-2).
    *   Lack of specific rules for "multiple discounts" (FR-3).
    *   Subjectivity of "seamless," "robust," "intuitive," "high-performing" (Overview, Merchant Goal).
    *   Missing detailed requirements for "Track abandoned carts" and "Gain insights into customer purchasing behavior" (Merchant Goals).
*   **Scope Creep Risk:**
    *   Merchant goals for analytics/insights (abandoned carts, purchasing behavior) are not detailed in FRDs, creating pressure for additional features.
    *   "Platform Differentiation" (Business Goal) is broad and could lead to feature creep.
    *   "Save for Later" (FR-6) is medium priority, but stakeholder insistence could lead to scope creep if not managed.
*   **Project Management Risk:**
    *   High priority for almost all FRDs (1-5) indicates an aggressive scope, potentially leading to delays or quality issues.
    *   Dependencies on external systems (inventory, shipping, promotions) for FR-2, FR-3, FR-4.
    *   Resource availability/expertise for complex features (real-time inventory, persistent cart merging).
*   **Stakeholder Risk:**
    *   Differing interpretations of subjective goals (e.g., "seamless experience").
    *   Potential disagreements on ambiguous requirements (shipping, taxes, discount rules).
*   **Technical Risk:**
    *   Explicitly mentioned PRD risks: Technical Scalability, Data Integrity, Performance Issues, Complex Integrations, Security Vulnerabilities.
    *   Real-time Inventory Validation (FR-4) is technically challenging at scale.
    *   Persistent Cart Merging Logic (FR-5) is complex and prone to errors.
    *   Discount Engine Complexity (FR-3) for various rules.
    *   Software supply chain risks (recent insight) for integrations.
*   **Quality Risk:**
    *   User Experience Friction (PRD risk) if UI updates are not immediate, error messages are unclear, or flow is not intuitive.
    *   Accuracy of calculations (FR-2, FR-3) is critical.
    *   Reliability of Real-time Inventory (FR-4) to prevent out-of-stock purchases.
    *   Cart Persistence Issues (FR-5) like disappearing items or incorrect merging.
*   **Market/Strategic Risk:**
    *   Failure to achieve "Increase Conversion Rates" and "Reduce Cart Abandonment" (Business Goals).
    *   Failure to achieve "Platform Differentiation" (Business Goal) in a crowded market (recent insight).
    *   Negative brand perception due to poor UX, performance, or security.
*   **Communication Risk:**
    *   Ambiguities in requirements (as identified in Requirement Risk) if not clarified.
    *   Lack of clear communication regarding integration dependencies and potential delays.
    *   Insufficient communication of technical constraints or trade-offs to non-technical stakeholders.

Now, I will structure the output as requested.
