- A user can increase or decrease the quantity of an item already in the cart.
- A user can remove an item from the cart.
- The cart subtotal and individual item prices update instantly upon quantity changes or item removal.
- The system prevents adding out-of-stock items to the cart or flags them if they become unavailable while in the cart.

### FR-2: Persistent Shopping Cart for Logged-in Users

- Guest users' carts are persisted for a defined duration (e.g., 24 hours) using browser cookies.

### FR-3: Save for Later Functionality

**Description:** Users should be able to move items from their active shopping cart to a 'Save for Later' list, allowing them to consider these items for future purchases without cluttering their current cart.

**Priority:** Medium

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The cart page displays estimated tax and shipping costs (if applicable) before proceeding to checkout.
- A prominent 'Proceed to Checkout' button is available and clearly visible.
- Clicking 'Proceed to Checkout' navigates the user to the first step of the checkout process.

### FR-5: Real-time Inventory Availability Check

**Description:** The system must check and display the real-time availability of products in the shopping cart, alerting users if an item is out of stock or has limited quantity, and preventing checkout with unavailable items.

**Priority:** High

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When an item in the cart goes out of stock, the user is notified on the cart page.
- Users cannot proceed to checkout if their cart contains out-of-stock items.
- If an item's available quantity is less than the quantity in the cart, the user is prompted to adjust the quantity.

## 3. Risk Analysis

### Analysis Summary
THINKING: The user wants a detailed risk analysis of the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the "Shopping Cart Management" feature, incorporating recent risk insights. I need to categorize these risks into specific types, assign a severity, provide a clear description, and indicate if a specific law (DDPA) is relevant.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to identify and categorize potential risks associated with the "Shopping Cart Management" feature, considering both the PRD and external risk insights. The output needs a detailed explanation first, followed by a structured JSON array.

2.  **Initial Scan of PRD - Overview & Goals:**
    *   "Robust, intuitive, efficient shopping cart experience" - sets high expectations for quality and performance.
    *   "Driving conversion rates, reducing cart abandonment" - direct business impact, making any related risks high severity.
    *   "Valuable insights and operational efficiencies for merchants" - implies data collection, analytics, and potentially complex backend features.
    *   **Personas:** Shopper goals (efficiency, save for later, checkout, security) and Merchant goals (insights, inventory, promotions, efficiency, revenue). These highlight areas where failure could lead to dissatisfaction or missed business objectives.
    *   **Business Goals & Success Metrics:** These are critical. Any risk that jeopardizes these metrics (conversion, abandonment, AOV, CSAT, error rate, page load, adoption) is significant.

3.  **Analyze PRD's Pre-identified Risks:** The PRD itself lists several risks. I'll use these as a starting point and elaborate on them, categorizing them into the required types.
    *   `Technical Complexity`: Directly maps to **Technical Risk**.
    *   `Performance & Scalability`: Directly maps to **Technical Risk**.
    *   `Security Vulnerabilities`: Maps to **Technical Risk** and potentially **Quality Risk**. This will also trigger the `law` attribute.
    *   `User Experience Issues`: Maps to **Quality Risk** and impacts **Market/Strategic Risk**.
    *   `Integration Challenges`: Directly maps to **Technical Risk**.
    *   `Data Privacy Compliance`: Maps to **Market/Strategic Risk** (regulatory) and **Technical Risk** (implementation). This will also trigger the `law` attribute.

4.  **Deep Dive into Functional Requirements (FRDs):**
    *   **FR-1 (Item Management):** "Dynamically update," "prevents adding out-of-stock items." This implies real-time inventory integration, adding complexity.
    *   **FR-2 (Persistent Cart):** "Saved across sessions and devices," "synchronized across multiple devices," "guest users' carts are persisted." This is a major technical challenge for data consistency, storage, and synchronization logic. Also has data privacy implications.
    *   **FR-3 (Save for Later):** Requires separate storage and management, adding to data complexity.
    *   **FR-4 (Summary & Checkout):** "Estimated taxes, shipping costs (if applicable)." Requires integration with external services.
    *   **FR-5 (Real-time Inventory):** Explicitly "real-time availability," "dynamically on the cart page without requiring a full page refresh." This is a high-complexity, high-performance requirement, heavily reliant on robust integration.

5.  **Integrate Recent Risk Insights:** These insights provide external context and emerging trends.
    *   "AI and ML in shopping cart software," "sophisticated analytics dashboards," "personalized customer experiences": These align with the PRD's mention of "personalized recommendations" and "insights for merchants." If PF-1 doesn't incorporate these, it's a **Market/Strategic Risk** (competitive disadvantage). If it tries to, it's a **Technical Risk** (complexity) and **Scope Creep Risk** (if not clearly defined).
    *   "Seamless checkout experience," "stronger security," "customizable functions," "diverse range of payment gateways": Reinforce existing PRD risks (UX, security, integration) and highlight competitive pressures.
    *   "Managing software risks in 2025 in light of AI and the expanding attack surface": General reinforcement of **Technical Risk** and **Security Risk**.

6.  **Categorize and Elaborate on Risks:** Now, I'll map the identified points to the specified risk types, determine severity, and write descriptions.

    *   **Requirement Risk:** Ambiguity around "personalized recommendations" and "complex promotions" (mentioned in PRD risks but not detailed in FRDs).
    *   **Scope Creep Risk:** The vague nature of "personalized recommendations" and "complex promotions," coupled with market trends (AI/ML), could lead to feature requests beyond initial scope.
    *   **Project Management Risk:** High number of "High" priority FRDs with significant technical complexity (real-time, cross-device sync, integrations) suggests potential for delays if not managed meticulously.
    *   **Stakeholder Risk:** Balancing shopper (UX, security) and merchant (insights, promotions, efficiency) goals could lead to conflicting priorities.
    *   **Technical Risk:**
        *   *Complexity & Integration:* Real-time inventory (FR-5), cross-device persistence (FR-2), "Save for Later" (FR-3), external integrations (payment, shipping, tax - FR-4, PRD risks).
        *   *Performance & Scalability:* Maintaining speed under high load with real-time updates (PRD risks, FR-5).
        *   *Security Vulnerabilities:* Protecting sensitive data, expanding attack surface (PRD risks, recent insights).
    *   **Quality Risk:**
        *   *User Experience Issues:* Poor design, slowness, confusion leading to abandonment (PRD risks).
        *   *Data Inconsistency:* Challenges with persistent carts and real-time inventory updates.
    *   **Market/Strategic Risk:**
        *   *Competitive Disadvantage:* Not keeping pace with AI/ML, advanced analytics, seamless checkout, diverse payment options (recent insights).
        *   *Regulatory Compliance (Data Privacy):* Explicitly mentioned in PRD (GDPR, CCPA) and relevant for persistent carts and personalized features.
    *   **Communication Risk:** High complexity and multiple integrations require excellent communication to avoid misunderstandings.

7.  **Assign Severity and Law:**
    *   **High Severity:** Risks directly impacting conversion, abandonment, security, legal compliance, or core functionality.
    *   **Medium Severity:** Risks leading to significant delays, rework, or moderate user/merchant dissatisfaction.
    *   **Low Severity:** (None identified as critical for this project).
    *   **Law:** "DDPA" for any data protection-related risks (Security, Regulatory Compliance), "null" otherwise.

8.  **Format Output:** Ensure the detailed explanation comes first, followed by the JSON array, adhering strictly to the specified structure and constraints. Double-check JSON validity.

This systematic approach ensures all inputs are considered, risks are thoroughly analyzed, and the output meets all specified requirements.
