## 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Overview
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the requirements for the 'BRD Analysis' feature, a core component of the 'BRD-Based Project'. The primary objective of this feature is to enhance the quality, clarity, and completeness of Business Requirements Documents (BRDs) by providing systematic tools and processes for their analysis. This initiative aims to significantly reduce rework, mitigate scope creep, accelerate development cycles, and improve overall stakeholder alignment by proactively identifying gaps, ambiguities, inconsistencies, and potential conflicts within requirements before they progress to development.

### Business Goals
- Improve the overall quality, clarity, and completeness of Business Requirements Documents (BRDs).
- Reduce rework, scope creep, and project delays caused by unclear or incomplete requirements.
- Accelerate the development cycle by ensuring requirements are well-understood and validated upfront.
- Enhance collaboration and alignment among all stakeholders regarding project requirements.
- Minimize project risks associated with misunderstood or missing requirements.

## 2. Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

### FR-1: BRD Content Ingestion and Management
**Description:** The system shall enable users to upload BRD documents in various formats (e.g., DOCX, PDF, Markdown, HTML, plain text) for analysis. It shall also provide basic document management capabilities such as viewing, renaming, and deleting uploaded BRDs.

### FR-2: BRD Clarity and Ambiguity Analysis
**Description:** The system shall analyze the uploaded BRD content to identify and flag ambiguous terms, vague statements, subjective language, and potentially unclear requirements that could lead to misinterpretation or rework.

### FR-3: BRD Consistency and Completeness Analysis
**Description:** The system shall analyze the BRD for internal consistency, identifying conflicting requirements, inconsistent terminology, and missing essential sections or information based on predefined BRD templates or best practices.

### FR-4: Interactive Analysis Report Generation and Visualization
**Description:** The system shall generate a comprehensive, interactive report summarizing all identified issues (ambiguity, consistency, completeness, etc.) from the BRD analysis. The report should allow users to navigate findings, view details, and filter results.

### FR-5: Integration with External Requirements Management Systems
**Description:** The system shall provide capabilities to integrate with popular requirements management and documentation platforms (e.g., Jira, Confluence) to directly pull BRD content for analysis and to push analysis findings back to these systems, enabling traceability.
